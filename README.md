\`\`\`

## Usage

### Simple and Powerful

#### Using Promises

\`\`\`javascript
const scanDirectory = require('node-recursive-directory');

scanDirectory('./path/to/dir')
.then(files => console.log(files))
.catch(err => console.error(err));
\`\`\`

#### Using async/await

\`\`\`javascript
const scanDirectory = require('node-recursive-directory');

(async () => {
try {
const files = await scanDirectory('./path/to/dir');
console.log(files);
} catch (err) {
console.error(err);
}
})();
\`\`\`

### Detailed File Information

Need more than just file paths? Get detailed file info with a simple switch.

#### Using Promises

\`\`\`javascript
const scanDirectory = require('node-recursive-directory');

scanDirectory('./path/to/dir', true)
.then(filesObject => console.log(filesObject))
.catch(err => console.error(err));
\`\`\`

#### Using async/await

\`\`\`javascript
const scanDirectory = require('node-recursive-directory');

(async () => {
try {
const filesObject = await scanDirectory('./path/to/dir', true);
console.log(filesObject);
} catch (err) {
console.error(err);
}
})();
\`\`\`

## Example

\`\`\`javascript
const scanDirectory = require('node-recursive-directory');

// Example: Get detailed file information
(async () => {
try {
const filesObject = await scanDirectory('./my-project', true);
filesObject.forEach(file => {
console.log(\`Found file: \${file.filename} in directory: \${file.dirname}\`);
});
} catch (err) {
console.error('Error:', err);
}
})();
